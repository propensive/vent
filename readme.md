## Vent

__Vent__ is an experimental work-in-progress build repository for publishing Scala
projects built with [Fury](https://github.com/propensive/fury/), with the goal
of representing a coherent ecosystem of libraries from which Scala software can
be built.

At the current time, Fury has not yet been released, and this repository
contains only experimental data, so there is not much to see here yet.
